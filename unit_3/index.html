<div id="intro"> 
	<p>I'm here to give you a glimpse of Trinidad and Tobago, where di vibes nice,
	<br>di sun hot, and di talk sweet! I've heard it said that once you've been to one island,  
	<br>you've been to them all; I beg to differ. Beauty, culture, and freedom of life
	<br> awaits those who dare to break out of the secluded tourist resorts 
	<br>and experience the destination for what it is. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Welcome to my world. Leh we go! (Let's go!)</p>
